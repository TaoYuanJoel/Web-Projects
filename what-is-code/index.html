            <h1>Why Are Programmers So Intense About Languages?</h1>
            <p>Many conferences are organized around specific programming languages or specific communities
                <br>
                (PyCon for
                Python programmers; the Strata conference for big data; Oscon for open-source coders);
                <br>
                These are ritual
                events for the people in those communities. Attendees gather, talk, and post the videos on YouTube.

                        reddit.com/r/programming currently has 620,202 readers), or Hacker News, run by the venture

                        about
                        the influential programming language Scheme—the more inside-baseball the name, the nerdier the
                        subject matter).

                        There are hundreds of programming blogs. Many large corporations let their engineers blog (a
                        generous gift, given how many recruiters are hovering). Discussions about programming go on
                        everywhere, in public, at all times, about hundreds of languages. There is a keen sense of
                        what’s
                        coming up and what’s fading out.

                    <p class="context">
                        It’s not simply fashion; one’s career as a programmer depends on demonstrating capacity in one
                        or
                        more languages. So there are rankings, frequently updated, rarely shocking. As of April 15, the
                        world’s most-used computer languages, according to the Tiobe index (which uses a variety of
                        indicators to generate a single ranking for the world of programming), are Java, C, C++,
                        Objective-C, and C#, followed by JavaScript, PHP, and Python. The rankings are necessarily
                        inexact;
                        another list, by a consulting firm called RedMonk, gives JavaScript the top spot, followed by
                        Java.
                        There are many possible conclusions here, but the obvious one is that, all things being equal, a
                        very good Java programmer who performs well in interviews will have more career options than a
                        similar candidate using a more obscure language.

                        If you code, by the time a language breaks through to the top 10 or 20, you’ve heard of it, read
                        blog posts about it, heard people lament how terrible or wonderful or misguided it is, possibly
                        watched a few video tutorials, or played with it a little. Taking new languages out for a spin
                        is a
                        good thing for a programmer to do. Often all you have to do is download some files and write a
                        couple lines of code, then decide if you want to go further. Most languages are free to download
                        and
                        use.

                        Why do people construct and then give away free languages? Well, the creation of a good
                        computer
                        language is the work of an apex programmer. To have produced a successful language is
                        acknowledged
                        as a monumental effort, akin to publishing a multivolume history of a war, or fighting in
                        one.

                        Changing a language is like fighting that war all over again, and some languages have at times
                        been
                        trapped in a liminal state between their old, busted selves, and their new, promised version.
                        Perl
                        5, released in the mid-1990s, was a language uniquely suited to the World Wide Web, and it grew
                        as
                        the Web grew; Perl 6 was supposed to be better in every way, and a redesign began with grand
                        pronouncements in 2000. But after 15 years of people working continually and often for free on a
                        project they consider in the public interest, there’s still no official Perl 6. (Latest ETA:
                        Christmas 2015.)

                        The Python language community, keenly aware of the Perl community’s problems, decided to
                        make
                        necessary but difficult changes to the language as part of the transition from Version 2 to

                        3. They would modernize, clean up rough edges—but avoid grand reinventions. Development of

                        3.0 started in 2006; the first working version came out in 2008; and in 2015, the transition
                        is
                        ongoing.

                        Making a new language is hard. Making a popular language is much harder still and requires the
                        smile
                        of fortune. And changing the way a popular language works appears to be one of the most
                        difficult
                        things humans can do, requiring years of coordination to make the standards align. Languages are

                <p class="context">
                    The true measure of a language isn’t how it uses semicolons; it’s the standard library of each
                    language.
                    A language is software for making software. The standard library is a set of premade software that
                    you
                    can reuse and reapply.
                </p>
                <p class="context">
                    Take Python, which is “batteries included,” meaning that it comes with tons of preexisting code,
                    organized into “modules,” that you can reuse. Its standard library has functions that let you copy
                    Web
                    pages or replace words in a document.
                    What does that mean, to process text? Well, you might have a string of text (The Quick Brown Fox)
                    and
                    save it in a variable called my_string. So now you can call standard methods on that string. You can
                    say
                    my_string.lower(), and it will make all the words lowercase, producing “the quick brown fox.”

                <p class="context">
                    Truly understanding a language’s standard library is one of the ways one becomes proficient in that
                    language. Typically you just visit Web pages or read a book.
                </p>
                <p class="context">
                    But the standard library is only the beginning. For many languages—and Python is exemplary—there’s
                    an
                    enormous library of prewritten modules available for nearly instantaneous download, using “package
                    manager” software. A module (or library, or package) is code that is intended to extend a language’s
                    capabilities.

                    sharpen them.

                    You type one command: sudo pip install Pillow, and the Pillow module is downloaded, compiled
                    automatically, and placed into the correct directory for later reuse. You have to know, of course,
                    that
                    most modern languages have modules for image processing; you also need to know that Pillow is the
                    most
                    commonly used image-processing toolkit. Knowing how to find that out is part of the job of coding.
                    You
                    might learn it by Googling. You might ask a friend. You might get that information out of a book, or
                    a
                    website like The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python.

                    A coder needs to be able to quickly examine and identify which giant, complex library is the one
                    that’s
                    the most recently and actively updated and the best match for his or her current needs. A coder
                    needs to
                    be a good listener.

                <p class="context">
                    But what a payoff! Now that Pillow is installed, you have, at your typing fingertips, dozens of
                    routines
                    and functions related to image processing that you can use in your code: change colors, rotate by a
                    number of degrees, scale, convert GIF images to JPEGs, and so forth. Or if you need to do very
                    complex
                    numerical analysis and statistics work, you can download NumPy, and suddenly an enormous range of
                    mathematical algorithms are available to you, hundreds of years of science and research boiled down.
                    Audio processing, interacting with peculiar hardware, speaking to databases—there are packages for
                    all
                    of these things. But you need to know how to find them, what they are called. Code isn’t just
                    obscure
                    commands in a file. It requires you to have a map in your head, to know where the good libraries,
                    the
                    best documentation, and the most helpful message boards are located. If you don’t know where those
                    things are, you will spend all of your time searching, instead of building cool new things.

                                    it’s harder to make C code and Java code work together. C and Java represent the

                        C is as big a deal as you can get in computing. Created by Dennis Ritchie starting in the late
                        1960s at Bell Labs, it’s the principal development language of the UNIX operating system. Unix
                        (lowercased now, to refer to the idea of Unix instead of the branded version) is a simple
                        operating system—basically it’s a kernel12 that manages memory and runs software, a large
                        collection of very small utility programs, and a “shell” that helps you knit programs into
                        “shell scripts.” If you couldn’t do what you needed with shell scripts, you might write a new
                        utility in C and add it to the utility library. This was a nice and practical way of working,
                        and it coincided with the rise of various kinds of networks that today we refer to collectively
                        as the Internet. So Unix spread from Bell Labs to academia, to large industrial systems, and
                        eventually leached into the water supply of computing until it was everywhere. And everywhere
                        that Unix went, C was sure to go.

                        to making it really, ridiculously fast. These are called optimizations, and they are to
                        programming what loopholes are to taxes. Think of C as sort of a plain-spoken grandfather who
                        grew up trapping beavers and served in several wars but can still do 50 pullups.

                        actuarial tables. It was in K&R that “Hello, world!” became the canonical example program for

                        There are many definitions. I’ll wade in and provide my own and face the consequences.
                        Object-oriented programming is, at its essence, a filing system for code. As anyone who’s ever
                        shared a networked folder—or organized a physical filing cabinet—knows, without a good shared
                        filing system your office will implode. C, people said in the 1980s and ’90s, is a great
                        language! An excellent language! But it doesn’t really let you organize things. You end up with
                        all these functions. It’s a mess. I mean, we have this data structure for our customers (name,
                        address, and so forth), and we have all these functions for manipulating that data
                        (update_address, send_bill, delete_account), but the thing is, those functions aren’t related to
                        the data except by the naming convention. C doesn’t have a consistent way to name things. Which
                        means it’s hard to find them later. Object-oriented programming gave programmers a great way to
                        name things—a means of building up a library. I could call (run) update_address on a picture of
                        a dog or an Internet address. That approach is sloppy and dangerous and leads to bugs (our
                        forebears reasoned, and not without precedent), and it makes it hard to program with big teams
                        and keep track of everything.

                        name was designed to … simulate things. While C was created within the New Jersey research
                        facilities (Bell Labs) of an industrial monolith (AT&T) to solve problems at hand, Smalltalk was
                        built at the far-off California outpost of a different industrial monolith, Xerox, to solve the
                        problems of the distant future. Thus Smalltalk represents the world differently than C.

                        Smalltalk has a funny name and a friendly attitude, but its specification ran to 700 pages. It
                        was a big system. C gave you an abstraction over the entire computer, helping you manage memory
                        and processes inside the machine. Smalltalk gave you an abstraction over all of reality, so you
                        could start dividing the world into classes and methods and the like. Where C tried to make it
                        easier to do computer things, Smalltalk tried to make it easier to do human things.

                        This isn’t better or worse. It’s just different. Here is some Smalltalk code:

                        Transcript show: 'Hello, world!'.
                        It prints that short sentence in the Transcript Window on the user’s screen. The Transcript is
                        an object—and here it’s receiving a message (show:) with an argument—i.e., input—“Hello,” etc.
                        You type that in, select it with your mouse (even in the early 1980s), and tell the computer to
                        execute it. It compiles just that bit of code and adds it to the rest of the running system. It
                        looks like this:

                            dive right into this living, breathing, window-full environment, and start making new
                            objects that send messages to other objects. If you save where you are, and come back five

                        The thing is, all those boxes can be manipulated. They’re all objects. It’s almost too powerful:
                        The boundaries that are clear in most languages—between data and code, between files and
                        executables, between the operating system and applications, between closed and open software—all
                        of those borders are fuzzed by design. Smalltalk is a vision of the computer as its own, native
                        medium. The whole system can be modified, by anyone. The dominant version is called Squeak
                        (logo: cute mouse), and a modernized version is called Pharo (logo: lighthouse). Both are free
                        and easy to download.

                        As a middling programmer I find the Smalltalk environment fascinating, but it never pulls me all
                        the way through the looking glass. One day, I’ve promised myself, I’ll read (or skim with
                        intent) the huge Smalltalk specification from the 1980s—a seminal text and a grand attempt to
                        organize reality along computer principles. The problem is that Smalltalk requires one to adopt
                        not just a method of working but also a philosophy of the world, where everything is organized
                        in a hierarchy of classes. I love to play with it, but I typically stumble back to more familiar
                        approaches. Being an advocate for Smalltalk is a little like being very into Slovenian cinema or
                        free jazz. Some of its advocates are particularly brilliant people. I’m not one of them.

                        Smalltalk’s history is often described as slightly tragic, because many of its best ideas never
                        permeated the culture of code. But it’s still around, still has users, and anyone can use Squeak
                        or Pharo. Also—

                    <p class="context">
                        Python is a very interesting language and quite popular, too. It’s object-oriented but not
                        rigid.15 And it’s widely understood to be easier than C for programmers to use, because it
                        provides more abstractions for programmers to reuse. It hides much of the weirdness of the
                        computer and many details of how computation is performed. Python is usually slower than C; this
                        is the price you pay for all those sweet levels of abstraction. In the vast majority of cases
                        this difference in speed truly doesn’t matter, regardless of how much people protest. It’s only
                        of consequence when you’ve built up a system in Python and a part of it runs millions or
                        billions of times, slowing down the computer—and thus requiring more resources to get its work
                        done.
                    </p>
                    <p class="context">
                        What then? Does this mean you need to throw away all your Python and start over in some other
                        language? Probably not. Python has a deserved reputation as a “glue language,” meaning you can
                        take code from other, lower-level languages such as C, C++, and Fortran 77 (yes, as in the year
                        1977), code that is close to the machine and known to be sound, and write “wrapper functions.”
                        That is, you can embed the older, faster code in the newer, slower, but easier-to-use system.

                    <p class="context">
                        A big part of this process is in wrapping up the old code in nice, well-organized Python
                        functions. In many ways the idiom of a language is not just how it looks but also how it feels.
                        Some languages emphasize brevity. Some support long, complex functions, while others encourage
                        you to break up functionality into small pieces. Style and usage matter; sometimes programmers
                        recommend Strunk & White’s The Elements of Style—that’s right, the one about the English
                        language. Its focus on efficient usage resonates with programmers. The idiom of a language is
                        part of its communal identity.

                    <p class="context">
                        Python is not the glue for everything, though. It’s hard to connect to Java but fits C hand to
                        glove. There’s a version of Python designed to run inside of Java and use Java code. That’s
                        called Jython. If you want a version that works with Microsoft’s .NET, you can go with
                        IronPython.

                    <p class="context">
                        But there’s another way to interpret all this activity around Python: People love it and want it
                        to work everywhere and do everything. They’ve spent tens of thousands of hours making that
                        possible and then given the fruit of their labor away. That’s a powerful indicator. A huge
                        amount of effort has gone into making Python practical as well as pleasurable to use. There are
                        lots of conferences, frequent code updates, and vibrant mailing lists. You pick a language not
                        just on its technical merits, or its speediness, or the job opportunities it may present, but
                        also on its culture.
