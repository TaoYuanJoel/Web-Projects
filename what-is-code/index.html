            <h1>Why Are Programmers So Intense About Languages?</h1>
            <p>Many conferences are organized around specific programming languages or specific communities
                <br>
                (PyCon for
                Python programmers; the Strata conference for big data; Oscon for open-source coders);
                <br>
                These are ritual
                events for the people in those communities. Attendees gather, talk, and post the videos on YouTube.

                        reddit.com/r/programming currently has 620,202 readers), or Hacker News, run by the venture

                        functions), or Lambda the Ultimate (named after a series of papers written mostly in the 1970s
                        about
                        the influential programming language Scheme—the more inside-baseball the name, the nerdier the

                        There are hundreds of programming blogs. Many large corporations let their engineers blog (a
                        generous gift, given how many recruiters are hovering). Discussions about programming go on
                        everywhere, in public, at all times, about hundreds of languages. There is a keen sense of
                        what’s
                        coming up and what’s fading out.

                    <p class="context">
                        It’s not simply fashion; one’s career as a programmer depends on demonstrating capacity in one
                        or
                        more languages. So there are rankings, frequently updated, rarely shocking. As of April 15, the
                        world’s most-used computer languages, according to the Tiobe index (which uses a variety of
                        indicators to generate a single ranking for the world of programming), are Java, C, C++,
                        Objective-C, and C#, followed by JavaScript, PHP, and Python. The rankings are necessarily
                        inexact;
                        another list, by a consulting firm called RedMonk, gives JavaScript the top spot, followed by
                        Java.
                        There are many possible conclusions here, but the obvious one is that, all things being equal, a
                        very good Java programmer who performs well in interviews will have more career options than a
                        similar candidate using a more obscure language.

                        If you code, by the time a language breaks through to the top 10 or 20, you’ve heard of it, read
                        blog posts about it, heard people lament how terrible or wonderful or misguided it is, possibly
                        watched a few video tutorials, or played with it a little. Taking new languages out for a spin
                        is a
                        good thing for a programmer to do. Often all you have to do is download some files and write a
                        couple lines of code, then decide if you want to go further. Most languages are free to download
                        and
                        use.

                        Why do people construct and then give away free languages? Well, the creation of a good
                        computer
                        language is the work of an apex programmer. To have produced a successful language is
                        acknowledged
                        as a monumental effort, akin to publishing a multivolume history of a war, or fighting in
                        one.

                        Changing a language is like fighting that war all over again, and some languages have at times

                        trapped in a liminal state between their old, busted selves, and their new, promised version.
                        Perl
                        5, released in the mid-1990s, was a language uniquely suited to the World Wide Web, and it grew
                        as
                        the Web grew; Perl 6 was supposed to be better in every way, and a redesign began with grand
                        pronouncements in 2000. But after 15 years of people working continually and often for free on a
                        project they consider in the public interest, there’s still no official Perl 6. (Latest ETA:
                        Christmas 2015.)

                        The Python language community, keenly aware of the Perl community’s problems, decided to
                        make
                        necessary but difficult changes to the language as part of the transition from Version 2 to

                        3. They would modernize, clean up rough edges—but avoid grand reinventions. Development of

                        Making a new language is hard. Making a popular language is much harder still and requires the
                        smile
                        of fortune. And changing the way a popular language works appears to be one of the most

                        things humans can do, requiring years of coordination to make the standards align. Languages are

                <h3 class="card-title">The Beauty of the Standard Library</h3>
                <p class="context">
                    The true measure of a language isn’t how it uses semicolons; it’s the standard library of each
                    language.
                    A language is software for making software. The standard library is a set of premade software that
                    you
                    can reuse and reapply.

                    Take Python, which is “batteries included,” meaning that it comes with tons of preexisting code,
                    organized into “modules,” that you can reuse. Its standard library has functions that let you copy
                    Web
                    pages or replace words in a document.
                    What does that mean, to process text? Well, you might have a string of text (The Quick Brown Fox)
                    and
                    save it in a variable called my_string. So now you can call standard methods on that string. You can
                    say
                    my_string.lower(), and it will make all the words lowercase, producing “the quick brown fox.”

                    Truly understanding a language’s standard library is one of the ways one becomes proficient in that
                    language. Typically you just visit Web pages or read a book.

                    But the standard library is only the beginning. For many languages—and Python is exemplary—there’s
                    an
                    enormous library of prewritten modules available for nearly instantaneous download, using “package
                    manager” software. A module (or library, or package) is code that is intended to extend a language’s
                    capabilities.

                    Let’s say you work for an advertising agency and need to process through 100,000 pictures and scale
                    and
                    sharpen them.

                    You type one command: sudo pip install Pillow, and the Pillow module is downloaded, compiled
                    automatically, and placed into the correct directory for later reuse. You have to know, of course,
                    that
                    most modern languages have modules for image processing; you also need to know that Pillow is the
                    most
                    commonly used image-processing toolkit. Knowing how to find that out is part of the job of coding.
                    You
                    might learn it by Googling. You might ask a friend. You might get that information out of a book, or
                    a
                    website like The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python.

                    A coder needs to be able to quickly examine and identify which giant, complex library is the one
                    that’s
                    the most recently and actively updated and the best match for his or her current needs. A coder
                    needs to
                    be a good listener.

                    But what a payoff! Now that Pillow is installed, you have, at your typing fingertips, dozens of
                    routines
                    and functions related to image processing that you can use in your code: change colors, rotate by a
                    number of degrees, scale, convert GIF images to JPEGs, and so forth. Or if you need to do very
                    complex
                    numerical analysis and statistics work, you can download NumPy, and suddenly an enormous range of
                    mathematical algorithms are available to you, hundreds of years of science and research boiled down.
                    Audio processing, interacting with peculiar hardware, speaking to databases—there are packages for
                    all
                    of these things. But you need to know how to find them, what they are called. Code isn’t just
                    obscure
                    commands in a file. It requires you to have a map in your head, to know where the good libraries,
                    the
                    best documentation, and the most helpful message boards are located. If you don’t know where those
                    things are, you will spend all of your time searching, instead of building cool new things.

                                    If all computer languages do the same thing (make the computer do what you want),
                                    then
                                    why does it matter which one you choose? For the same reason that you wouldn’t take
                                    a
                                    bicycle to pick up a fridge or get a physical from an oncological neurosurgeon. Some
                                    tools are better for certain jobs.

                                    It’s possible for a C programmer and a Java programmer to read each other’s code,
                                    but
                                    it’s harder to make C code and Java code work together. C and Java represent the
                                    world
                                    in different ways, structure data in different ways, and address the components of
                                    the
                                    computer in different ways. There are true benefits to everyone on a team using the
                                    same
                                    language. They’re all thinking the same way about how to instruct the computer to
                                    process data.

                                    It’s not necessary for every team across a big organization to use the same
                                    language. In
                                    fact, it’s often counterproductive. Large organizations have lots of needs and use
                                    many
                                    languages and services to meet them. For example, Etsy is built atop PHP—but its
                                    product-search service uses Java libraries, because the solutions for search
                                    available
                                    in Java are great.

                                    Some programming languages, such as C, will do their best to do exactly as you ask,
                                    even
                                    if that means crashing your computer. Others, like OCaml and Haskell, are very
                                    constrained and ask a programmer to hew to a narrow form, trying to steer you away
                                    from
                                    anything stupid.

                                    There’s Scratch, a teaching language for kids. It doesn’t use text much at all but
                                    allows li’l coders to move icons around on screen and assemble programs like Legos.

                                    logo is a smiling cat on two legs.

                                    And then there’s Lisp, which didn’t come with a logo when it was first proposed in
                                    the

                                    Lisp is a classic language. There are some languages that just have authority,

                                    And one of these is C. Most of the popular languages look a lot like it. C’s de

                                    logo is, well, the letter C. C is called C because it came after another language.

                                    language was called B.
